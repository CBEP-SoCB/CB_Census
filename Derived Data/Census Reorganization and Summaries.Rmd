# Introduction
We are all familiar with the U.S. Census, or at least we think we are. 

Population growth and land use are key determinants of pollution loading to 
Casco Bay as well as habitat disturbance and disruption throughout the 
watershed.

The connection between population to environmental impact is not direct, as it
is mediated by affluence, technology, culture  and more.  Nonetheless, 
population change, especially differential population change across the region, 
helps us understand the demographic forces shaping Maine's landscape.

We use data from the U.S. Census and related products from the census to track 
demographic change.  Since State of the BAy Reports are issues every five years
and the census is conducted every tewn, we must look not only to the decennial 
census, but alsio to intermediate population estimates released by the U.S 
Census Bureau, related the the "American Community Survey."

In this notebook, we access demographic data on a town by town basis derived
from census data, and derive growth rate statistics for a variety of time 
periods.

This Notebook is not the same as the original Notebook used to conduct these 
calculations, but it contains the same calculations.

long_data <- the_data %>%

  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year)) %>%
  mutate(YearF = factor(Year, levels = c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2001, 2002, 
                                         2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 
                                         2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 
                                         2015, 2016, 2017, 2018)))
```

# Summarize Data
```{r}
total <- long_data %>%
  group_by(Group, Year) %>%
  summarize(Total = sum(Population, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
total
write.csv(total, 'CB_Total_Pop.csv')
```

# Quick and Dirty Population Growth Figures
```{r}
tmp <-  total %>%
  filter(Group == 'Estimate')

plt <- tmp %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, Total/1000)) + geom_point( size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', span=0.75) +
  xlab('Year') +
  ylab('Population of Casco Bay Towns (Thousands)') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,400))+
  ggtitle('Population of 48\nCasco Bay Watershed Towns\n1970-2018')
plt
```
The full Y scale minimizes the visibility of the population slow down and even
contraction from 2008 to 2010, but it is more honest in terms of the magnitude
of growth. HOWEVER the apparent population decline could also be because the ACS
is "recalibrated" with every decennial census.

# Population Growth Rates
We want population growth rates for Each town, and we have several possibly 
interesting periods of record:

1.  Total Period of ACS Records, 2000 through 2018  
2.  Recent 5 year periods

The easiest way to calculate a growth rate is in terms of the first and last 
years of a period of record only.

## Convenience Functions
```{r}
Tot.Pct.Change <- function(pops, yrs)
{
  firstpop <- pops[which.min(yrs)][1]  # could be multiple values in a given year...  select first one.
  firstyr <-   yrs[which.min(yrs)][1]
  lastpop <- pops[which.max(yrs)][1]
  lastyr <-   yrs[which.max(yrs)][1]
  tot <- 100*(lastpop-firstpop)/firstpop
  return(tot)
}
```

```{r}
Ann.Pct.Change <- function(pops, yrs)
{
  firstpop <- pops[which.min(yrs)][1]  # could be multiple values in a given year...  select first one.
  firstyr <-   yrs[which.min(yrs)][1]
  lastpop <- pops[which.max(yrs)][1]
  lastyr <-   yrs[which.max(yrs)][1]
  ann <- ((exp((log(lastpop)-log(firstpop))/(lastyr-firstyr)))-1)*100
  return(ann)
}
```

## Test the functions
```{r}
Tot.Pct.Change(tmp$Total, tmp$Year)
Ann.Pct.Change(tmp$Total, tmp$Year)
```
So, over the past 18 years, the region has grown at an average rate of about 
0.5% a year.

# Assemble a Data Table
## Growth over the Period of the American Community Survey 2000 - 2018
```{r}
tmp <- long_data %>%
  filter(Group =="Estimate") %>%
  filter(! is.na(Population) & Population !=0) %>%
  mutate(Source = ifelse(Group=='Estimate2', 'Estimate', Group)) %>%
  mutate(Source = ifelse(Source=='Estimate', 'ACS', Source)) %>%
  select(-Group) %>%
  filter(Source == 'ACS')

ACSGrowth <- tmp %>%
  group_by(NAME) %>%
  summarize(NAMELSAD=first(NAMELSAD),
            COUSUB = first(COUSUB),
            ACSFirstYr = min(Year),
            ACSAnnRate = Ann.Pct.Change(Population, Year),
            ACSGrowth = Tot.Pct.Change(Population, Year)) %>%
  ungroup()
ACSGrowth
```

## ACS growth in 2000 to 2005
```{r}
tmp <- long_data %>%
  filter(Group != 'Base') %>%
  mutate(Source = ifelse(Group=='Estimate', 'ACS', Group)) %>%
  select(-Group) %>%
  filter(Source == 'ACS') %>%
  filter(! is.na(Population) & Population !=0)

tmp2 <- tmp %>%
  filter(Year>1999 & Year < 2006)   # ONLY  2000 to 2005

ACSGrowth2000 <- tmp2 %>% group_by(NAME) %>%
  summarize(ACS2000AnnRate = Ann.Pct.Change(Population, Year),
            ACSPop2000= first(Population[Year==2000]) ) %>%
  ungroup()
ACSGrowth2000
```

## ACS growth in 2005 to 2010
```{r}
tmp2 <-  tmp %>%
  filter(Year>2004 & Year < 2011)   # ONLY  2005 to 2010

ACSGrowth2005 <- tmp2 %>% group_by(NAME) %>%
  summarize(ACS2005AnnRate = Ann.Pct.Change(Population, Year),
            ACSPop2010Left = first(Population[Year==2010])) %>%
  ungroup()
ACSGrowth2005
```

## ACS growth in 2010 to 2015 only
```{r}
tmp <- long_data %>%
  filter(Group != 'Base') %>%
  filter(!(Year==2010 & Group =='Estimate')) %>%   # Eliminate the 2000-2010 estimate of 2010 pop
  mutate(Source = ifelse(Group=='Estimate' | Group=='Estimate2', 'ACS', Group)) %>%
  select(-Group) %>%
  filter(Source == 'ACS') %>%
  filter(! is.na(Population) & Population !=0)
tmp2 <- tmp %>%
filter(Year>2009 & Year<2016)    # ONLY the  2010s data

ACSGrowth2010 <- tmp2 %>% group_by(NAME) %>%
  summarize(ACS2010AnnRate = Ann.Pct.Change(Population, Year),
            ACSPop2010Right = first(Population[Year==2010])) %>%
  ungroup()
ACSGrowth2010
```

## ACS growth in 2015 to 2018 only
```{r}
tmp2 <- tmp %>%
filter(Year>2014)    # ONLY the  2015s data on

ACSGrowth2015 <- tmp2 %>% group_by(NAME) %>%
  summarize(ACS2015AnnRate = Ann.Pct.Change(Population, Year),
            ACSPop2018 = first(Population[Year==2018])) %>%
  ungroup()
ACSGrowth2015
```

## Assemble a consistent data set
This might be slightly less error prone if we used `left_join()`, but here we 
get away with making some assumptions about the order of rows.

```{r}
growth_data <- bind_cols(ACSGrowth, ACSGrowth2000, ACSGrowth2005,
                         ACSGrowth2010, ACSGrowth2015) %>%
  select(-c(NAME...7, NAME...10, NAME...13, NAME...16)) %>%
  rename(NAME = NAME...1) %>%
  select("NAME", "NAMELSAD", "COUSUB", "ACSFirstYr" ,
         "ACSPop2000","ACSPop2010Left", "ACSPop2010Right","ACSPop2018",
         "ACSAnnRate", "ACS2000AnnRate", "ACS2005AnnRate", "ACS2010AnnRate",
         "ACS2015AnnRate", "ACSGrowth")
write.csv(growth_data, 'CB_Towns_Growth_Rates.csv')
```

# Plot Recent Growth vs. Size
```{r}
plt <- growth_data %>%
  filter( ! NAME == "Frye Island") %>%
  ggplot( aes(ACSPop2010Left, ACSGrowth)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
plt
```

```{r}
 rm(ACSGrowth, ACSGrowth2000, ACSGrowth2005, ACSGrowth2010, ACSGrowth2015, 
    tmp, tmp2,  plt)
```

# Plot Five Year Rates of Growth
Frye Island is weird because it's population is essentially zero
for the census, but higher during the summer, when the ACS applies. The tiny
Census numbers mean the percent change is unreasonably inflated.  So we want to
remove it.

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=7}
tmp <- growth_data %>%
  mutate(NAME = factor(NAME)) %>%
  mutate(NAME =  reorder(NAME, ACSGrowth)) %>%
  select(c(NAME,  contains('AnnRate'))) %>%
  rename_at(vars(contains('AnnRate')), ~substr(., 1, nchar(.)-7)) %>%
  rename(All = ACS) %>%
  rename_at(vars(contains('ACS')), ~substr(., 4,7)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-NAME, names_to='Year', values_to = 'Rate') %>%
  mutate(NAME = factor(NAME)) %>%
  filter(! (NAME == 'Frye Island'))
```

```{r}
xtabs(Rate~ NAME+Year, data = tmp)
```

Here, we order by average recent growth.
```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
plt <- tmp %>%
  filter(Year != 'All') %>%
  ggplot(aes(NAME, Rate, fill = Year)) + 
  geom_col(width = 0.75, position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  xlab ("") +
  ylab("Net Annual Growth Rate (%)")
plt
```

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=4}
plt <- tmp %>%
  filter(Year == 'All') %>%
  ggplot(aes(NAME, Rate)) + 
  geom_col(width = 0.75, fill = cbep_colors()[5]) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  xlab ("") +
  ylab("Net Annual Growth Rate (%)")
plt
```
